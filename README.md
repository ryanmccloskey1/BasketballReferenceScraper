# BasketballReferenceScraper
A Jupyter notebook used to scrape individual player data from BasketballReference.
The notebook was inspired by and altered from:
https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/intro-to-scraping-basketball-reference-data-8adcaa79664a

The aim was to obtain data using BeautifulSoup on player statistics over the previous 6 seasons. The data needed cleaned and put into a usable format after being scraped.
The variable "headers" within the scraper function needs to be the specific user agent to the device being used to run the code. 

Moreover, at certain times the website will refuse access if too many others are attempting to scrape the data as well.
